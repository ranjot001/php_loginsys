# php_loginsys
A sample login system with user registration, built with PHP, MySQL, jQuery and Bootstrap. 

In this project I've created a Login and Registration system using:
PHP
MySQL (MySQLi function)
JavaScript & jQuery.

You can import the database in your Mamp / Xampp {whatever you prefer} server.

This PHP login system is learned from CodeWithHarry Youtube Channel.
